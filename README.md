# discordsb
a versatile "user bot" for discord
---

Only two commands have been included as demo. Further commands may be included at your discretion.

You must replace the user token in the main.py with your own.

## DISCLAIMER: This could be against discord's TOS, however I am not sure, since they allow user applications now. Whatever you do with this, is upto you.
